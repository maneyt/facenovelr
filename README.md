## What is it?

If Facebook and Twitter were to have a love-child....well Facenovelr would be the outcome.
Facenovelr is a social networking app that allows you to connect with friends. 


## As a user I can:
* Upload information about myself (Name, Location, Profile Picture, Birthday & About Me)
* Upload photos to my image gallery. As well as view your friends galleries.
* Chat with friends through a pusher enabled chat box.
* Post a thought (can be thought of as a "status").
* Comment on friends thoughts.
* Like a friends photo or thought.
* and so much more...
